This work proposes a multi-objective-based visual sensor placement framework integrated with an efficient optimisation approach to solve this problem. The framework aims to maximise camera coverage and make ships in the images as detectable as possible, while minimising the budget. An improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) is developed to reduce run-time complexity by decreasing redundant computation and using adaptive memory matrices. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through simulation-based experiments conducted on the waterway beneath a long-span bridge. Two cases with different camera densities are explored. Compared to the standard NSGA-III and NSGA, the improved NSGA-III achieves higher computational efficacy and lower memory usage, resulting in optimal camera network layout for these scenarios. The optimised visual surveillance systems are illustrated within a three-dimensional proxy virtual environment. The corresponding videos, which have been temporally accelerated for ease of viewing.
